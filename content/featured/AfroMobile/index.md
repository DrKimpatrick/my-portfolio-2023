As a key team member, I collaborated on the development of the [Afro mobile app](https://afromobile.com/#/). This cutting-edge platform delivers a wide range of content, including breaking news, videos on demand, live streams, music, sports, lifestyle, and entertainment. Our project was commissioned by [Next Media](https://nextmedia.co.ug/), the largest media station in East Africa. Together, we created a powerful app that revolutionizes how users access and engage with diverse media content.
