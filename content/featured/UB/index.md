I have designed a high-performing API for the [Unclebob]('https://console.unclebob.org/') web and [mobile applications](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unclebob&hl=en&gl=US), enabling seamless communication between service providers and clients. The backend services are built with a focus on reliability, utilizing Kafka for efficient and reliable message exchange.
