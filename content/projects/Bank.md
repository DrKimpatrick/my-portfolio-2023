A lightweight core banking application that powers banking operations. It has a simple [UI](https://drkimpatrick.github.io/Banka/UI/) built with HTML, CSS and JS. It also has a [RESTful API](https://github.com/DrKimpatrick/Banka_API) that allows users to perform transactions and view their account details, built in Node/Express and uses data structures to store data in memory (No use of a database).
