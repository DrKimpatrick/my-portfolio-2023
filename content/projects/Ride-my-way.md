Ride-my-way App is a carpooling application that provides drivers with the ability to create ride oﬀers and passengers to join available ride oﬀers. Created the [UI](https://drkimpatrick.github.io/Carpool-Frontend-Mockup/request_ride.html) and [RESTful API](https://github.com/DrKimpatrick/Carpool_Backend_API/tree/master) endpoints for the application.
